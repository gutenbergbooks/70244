<p class="drop-cap">There is probably no man in America who has done more of
benefit to the profession of composing in this country than
has Deems Taylor, for through his own personal success he has
both proved and disproved certain definite impressions which
have clung traditionally to the composers’ craft, thereby clearing
a path that will make it far easier for others to proceed to
worth-while achievement in what has to date been classed as the
least favored of all arts.</p>

<p>He has proved that well-directed musical talent, plus those
qualities generally prescribed by exploiters of success-methods,
will find its way to fame even in these allegedly cold-tempered
United States.</p>

<p>He has proved that here a composer may raise himself by the
boot-straps and, suffering an avoidance of cheap sensationalism,
establish himself a figure in the general news of the day.</p>

<p>He has proved that a man may be essentially practical in his
manner of living, thinking and working and yet achieve international
distinction as a creator of highly imaginative music.</p>

<p>He has proved that versatility is no bar to special success—has
smashed the old saw that if you are a jack of all trades you
must, forsooth, be a master of none.</p>

<p>He has proved that there is a substantial market in this land
of industry, commerce and finance for products of purely artistic
calibre; that there is a living to be made out of composition.</p>

<p>Apply reverse English to these things he has proved by his
own record of accomplishment, and obviously your answer is
what he has disproved. Now, add the consideration that he has
destroyed the image so popularly prevalent that good composers
must be æsthetic, pale-skinned, long-haired and rather effeminate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
individuals, alternately rhapsodic and morose, constantly publishing
their complaint against a public that neither understands nor
appreciates them, and the case assumes completion.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>


<p>Deems Taylor is a mild-mannered person, of medium height,
inclined toward baldness, wears glasses, has what novelists describe
as well-chiselled features illumined by an expression of
intentness, emphasized by a firmly set lower jaw. As a man he
sizes up extremely well in a group of five, reading from left to
right, showing the Americans who had this past Spring been
awarded Doctor’s degrees by a great American University. His
companions in this distinguished cluster were the Chairman of
the General Electric Company’s Board, the President of the
American Museum of Natural History, the Secretary of State in
President Coolidge’s cabinet, and the professor of literature at
Yale University.</p>

<p>In the eyes of his intimates the address of seriousness which
he presents to casual observers is but a mask. For they know him
best as a man of unfailing good humor, a philosopher who delights
in the whimsicalities of life and knows both how to fashion
and enjoy a joke.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of Deems Taylor’s versatility. It is
not merely that he can do many things but it is because he does
them all superlatively well that this characteristic deserves
stressing. At various times he has functioned with outstanding
success as a newspaper-man, as critic, as linguist, as translator of
prose and poetry, as an artist capable of handling the brush and
pen with signal facility, as editor, as public speaker; and as
a composer.</p>

<p>In the field of journalism, both in his technical musical criticisms
and in his articles on practical musical subjects he writes
with clarity of style, with matured authority and with disarming
frankness and sincerity. Here again his engaging spirit of good
humor finds expression to lighten the burden of his message.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2>
</div>


<p>It is interesting to trace the steps by which Taylor advanced
himself to a position described by Dr. George Alexander, president
of the Council of New York University, as “one of the
foremost of the living composers.”</p>

<p>Deems Taylor is one of those rarest of residents of New York
who was actually born in that city. His arrival was dated just
three days before Christmas in the year 1885. He made his elementary
studies at the Ethical Culture School and graduated to
New York University, where his many-sided talents brought him
a conspicuous participation in under-graduate activities. The
records do not show it, but one takes it for granted that he
penned the sketches which adorned the year book of his class.
Probably he also wrote the sonnet which a distracted editor
called for to fill half a page needed to complete a folio. At fraternity
smokers he could always be relied upon to entertain; his
inimitable burlesque on grand opera, using as his “props” a varied
assortment of straw and felt hats, was certain to put the crowd
in good humor.</p>

<p>The record does show, however, that in association with a
class-mate, William LeBaron, who in later years was responsible
for the libretto of <em>Apple Blossoms</em>, the farce, <em>The Very Idea</em>, and
numerous other plays, Taylor wrote the music for four comic
operas during his collegiate term. One of them, <em>The Echo</em>, was
considered good enough by Charles Dillingham, the theatrical
producer, to merit a Broadway presentation, in which Bessie
McCoy was starred.</p>

<p>The innate desire for an adequate means of musical expression
must have reached its peak in the young man’s consciousness some
five years after his graduation from college, for it was at that
period that he undertook the serious study of harmony and
counterpoint. In the meantime he was struggling with the more
serious problems of life, trying to reconcile the meagre salary
paid to budding journalists with the ever-rising cost of living.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
One knows that this storm and stress period did exist in his life;
his own confessions, however, furnish but inadequate data upon
which to draw comparisons with similar experiences in the biographies
of other celebrated composers. His journalistic lineage
carries him through the editorship of a house organ, a brief engagement
as conductor of a humorous column in the now defunct
“New York Press,” the inevitable period of unemployment
(attendant to all newspaper careers); assistant editorship of
the “New York Tribune’s” Sunday magazine; correspondent in
France for the “Tribune,” in 1916 and 1917; associate editor
of “Collier’s Weekly” from 1917 until 1919; and music critic of
the New York “World” from 1921 to 1925. In August, 1927,
he became editor of “Musical America.”</p>

<p>Whether from natural inclination or from pressure of circumstances,
the early studies he had made in harmony and counterpoint
under Oscar Coon were not logically followed by directed
guidance in composition, instrumentation, and other subjects,
designed to prepare one for the career of composer. His sole researches
along these lines were self-made. As a composer he is
self-instructed, and it is the opinion of reliable critics that he
made an extremely good job of it. His studies in musical history
were sufficiently profound to equip him to give a series of lectures
on this subject in 1919 in Denver, Colo.</p>

<p>It was at this time that he formed a close friendship with
Percy Rector Stephens, the New York vocal instructor and then
conductor of the Schumann Club. Stephens had confidence in
the Taylor talent and lost no opportunity to promote the young
man’s progress. The purpose of the Schumann Club, it will be
recalled, was to deliver programs for women’s vocal ensemble that
would follow as closely as possible the canons dictating the structure
of artist recital programs. To achieve this laudable enterprise
it was necessary to adapt the music and render translated texts of
an entire library for the club. Mr. Taylor undertook the task
with enthusiasm and the product of his labors was among his first
essays in musical-literary effort to court serious critical attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The prize contest for composers, of which we have so many
now-a-days and which are so frequently condemned for their failures
to produce a National school of outstanding creative genius,
seems, nevertheless to find its associations in the biographies of
the current class of American composers. It was through this
means, by winning the first place in the National Federation of
Music Clubs competition in 1913, with his orchestral composition
<em>The Siren Song</em>, that Taylor attracted his first recognition as
a serious writer in the larger forms. Within three years he had
added to his output, in addition to numerous songs with piano
accompaniment, <em>Two Studies in Rhythm</em> for piano (Op. 5, Nos. 1
and 2); <em>The Chambered Nautilus</em> (Op. 7), a cantata for mixed
chorus and orchestra based on the poem of Oliver Wendell
Holmes; <em>The Highwayman</em> (Op. 8), a cantata for women’s voices
and orchestra, to the poem of Alfred Noyes; and a song cycle,
<em>The City of Joy</em>, to the poem by Charles Hanson Towne. In
<em>The Highwayman</em>, written especially for the MacDowell Festival
in Peterboro, N. H., in 1914, Taylor gave his first evidence of
that trait that was subsequently accepted as one of his native
characteristics, namely his ability to sense public taste. No student
of his record can escape consideration of this conspicuous
talent in his craft. <em>The Highwayman</em> soon found its place among
the most popular works in this form in our current music literature
and the name and fame of Deems Taylor grew accordingly.
He had raised himself immeasurably from the file of dilettante
composers, and discriminating critics began to look to him for
works of lasting importance.</p>

<p>In this respect they were not to be disappointed. Early in
1917 there came from his pen an orchestral work, which, through
sheer interest and merit forced itself into the repertoires of all of
our leading symphony organizations: <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>.
The first performance in New York proved an event of signal
interest in the news of the day and critics agreed that Taylor
had fully lived up to the promise which his earlier efforts had
offered. Within a few months orchestras in Paris and London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
had adopted the work, and thus he won his first recognition
among the few American writers who have had performances
abroad. The personal letters which Taylor received from several
of the greatest contemporary musicians both here and abroad,
on the strength of this music, may not be published; they show,
however, that he was now accepted by them as one of them.
His standing was secure.</p>

<p>Interrupting the output of works in the larger forms the
record shows numerous songs, many of which were taken up with
avidity by our leading concert singers and which will be discussed
later from a different angle.</p>

<p><em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, a rhapsody for strings, wind and the
piano, was the next of his more ambitious essays to win popular
approval.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV</h2>
</div>


<p>As a practical man Taylor realized that if he were to continue
his growth in serious music, he must find the means of livelihood
in avenues which offered a more immediate return in the currency
of the realm. He turned to the theatre and probably not without
a feeling that here he would find also the fundamentals upon
which he might some day build a work in the music drama form.
It was an inviting undertaking, offering both income and working
materials for future development. In 1922 he wrote the incidental
music for Austin Strong’s pantomime <em>A Man About
Town</em>, which graduated from the Comedy Club to the Ritz
Theatre. He had “broken into” the theatrical game and now
according to the custom of the Rialto, he was to be pursued
instead of being himself the pursuer in the quest for commissions.</p>

<p><em>Liliom</em> required music; Deems Taylor was the logical man to
supply it. A score was needed for the farce-comedy, <em>Dulcy</em>;
who better than Taylor could do it? In quick succession he added
to the list incidental music for the Winthrop Ames production,
<em>Will Shakespeare</em>, music for the Theatre Guild’s <em>The Adding Machine</em>,
a musical setting for Alan Seager’s <em>I Have a Rendezvous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
with Death</em>, in George Tyler’s production of <em>Humoresque</em>; the
incidental music for <em>Rita Coventry</em>; incidental music for Gilbert
Miller’s production of <em>Cazanova</em>; incidental music for <em>Beggar on
Horseback</em>, produced by Winthrop Ames in January, 1924, in
which was introduced the pantomime <em>A Kiss in Xanadu</em>; and
the score for the motion picture <em>Janice Meredith</em>.</p>

<p>The distinguished use to which Taylor later put the technic
he had acquired in these excursions into the theatre, saves them
from classification as “pot-boilers.” And, what is more to the
point, the music itself which he had written for these various
productions, was of a quality which calls for no apologetic comment.
Again he had shown his versatility and again he had added
to the stature of his name as a creative artist.</p>

<p>During the period of prolific productivity in the theatre
Taylor’s addresses to the audiences of the formal concert halls
were less frequent. Three outstanding works, however, found
expression amid the whirl of activity attendant upon daily reviews
of musical performances for his paper “The World,” with
his work often interrupted by conferences with producers,
scenario writers, playwrights, actors, managers and others, to
say nothing of the supervision of rehearsals. These contributions
were the song for baritone, <em>Captain Stratton’s Fancy</em>, a setting
of the John Masefield poem; the symphonic poem, <em>Jurgen</em> (Op.
17); and the suite for Jazz Orchestra, <em>Circus Day</em> (Op. 18), for
which the resourceful Ferdie Grofé was called upon to supply
the orchestral arrangement.</p>

<p><em>Jurgen</em> offers additional support to the contention made in
the opening paragraphs of this record. It is another example of
the service rendered by Deems Taylor to the cause of the American
composer, for it represents one of the pioneer instances in
which a conductor of an American symphony orchestra has
sought out an American composer and commissioned him to
write music for specific performance. Our composers had accustomed
themselves to regard our symphony orchestras and their
conductors as stumbling blocks in the road of progress. Taylor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
in company with George Gershwin and Henry K. Hadley, and
with the far-seeing Walter Damrosch as the instigator, was helping,
then and there, to change a securely established custom.
The orchestra was to go after the composer; and this shattering
of precedent is of far greater consequence than may seem
apparent to casual observance of the facts.</p>

<p>For the same reason the attitude of the Metropolitan Opera
Company toward the American composer and toward homemade
opera, is a subject which offers unlimited opportunities for
conjecture. Proof of an open-minded policy, a sincere desire to
bring forth the best that was to be had, is afforded by the action
(during the Winter of 1925) of the Board of Directors in commissioning
Deems Taylor, on the strength of his achievements in
other musical forms, to compose an opera which would be promised
a production. No restrictions were placed upon him: The
choice of a libretto was left entirely in his hands.</p>

<p>Note again the part which Deems Taylor was playing in the
breaking down of traditional methods to set the function of the
native composer in a new light.</p>

<p>When this call came to him, he determined to sacrifice every
other of his manifold activities to a successful prosecution of the
mission. Reluctantly he gave up the duties of music critic—a
position in which he was fast winning sympathetic and widespread
approval, even as the successor of the late James Gibbons
Huneker.</p>

<p>He turned with enthusiasm and high hopes to the task of
finding a libretto, a search which promised no easy fulfillment, for
little had been done in this land to stimulate the production of
operatic books that would satisfy the complex requirements of
the lyric stage.</p>

<p>Acting upon his own frequently expressed conviction that
a genuinely poetic and dramatic libretto is an indispensable
adjunct to the score of a grand opera, Mr. Taylor turned for
assistance to Edna St. Vincent Millay, whose volumes <em>Renascence</em>,
<em>Second April</em>, <em>A Few Figs From Thistles</em>, and <em>The Harp Weaver</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
have established her as one of the few great lyric poets of this
generation. Miss Millay’s response to the appeal was an idea
based upon a mediaeval legend; it was the story of <em>The King’s
Henchman</em>, and it made a strong appeal to Taylor’s inherent
sense of public taste. He could discover in it those elements
which meant operatic success. He bade Miss Millay to go on
with its development and meantime he busied himself with the
laying out of his patterns.</p>

<p>Two years later, on the evening of February 17th, 1927, the
world première of <em>The King’s Henchman</em> took place at the Metropolitan
Opera House. This was no ordinary première, even as
brilliant as such events usually are. For months in advance the
sagacious press department of the big theatre, aided enthusiastically
by a sympathetic press, had aroused public interest in the
production. The “Evening Post” declared that “Never in the
history of the Metropolitan Opera House had a native offering
been attended by such advance interest and such good omens
of success as <em>The King’s Henchman</em>.”</p>

<p>At the opera house, in the corridors, on the stage, back in
the executive offices, everywhere there existed a spirit of expectancy
and optimistic hope.</p>

<p>Tickets for the opening night were at a premium; on the
final day they were unpurchasable at any price. Again Deems
Taylor was making news.</p>

<p>The evening itself measured up fully to the anticipation it
had created. It went into the records as one of the most dazzling
of operatic premières; the audience actually liked the performance
as an opera; it seemed to enjoy itself hugely and there was
accordingly wild enthusiasm when the composer and librettist
were called to the front.</p>

<p>What was the effect of all this adulation, this frenzied praise
upon the man who was responsible for the success of the evening?
Again we turn to his intimates for the answer. We find him
reading, deeply solicitous, those words of criticism which measured
with scientific analysis, in a more discriminating vein, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
points of weakness in the score. He was neither professionally
“high hat” nor “up-stage.” It was his first grand opera and he
knew that he had yet to learn. He felt that he could learn most
from those who were prepared to show him how to step higher.
He absorbed these comments with none of the petulance of the
prima donna who finds in unfavorable criticism only the traces
of jealousy and lack of appreciation.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2>
</div>


<p>But most convincing of all in the testimony relating to the
outcome of the eventful evening’s proceedings, was the decision
of the Metropolitan Board of Directors, announced a few days
after the première, to commission Taylor to write a second opera
to be produced within two years from the date of his operatic
debut.</p>

<p>Some idea of the public interest aroused through this promise
of a second opera from Deems Taylor’s pen was reflected in the
large amount of space devoted to the project by the daily papers.
For several months after the announcement there was interested
speculation both in musical circles and in the newspapers over
the choice of his libretto. It was not until late in the Fall that
Mr. Taylor, in a column interview, gave out the news that had
been awaited with such lively anticipation; his manner of acquainting
the world with his selection was thoroughly characteristic.</p>

<p>The opera was to be based on an American novel, the identity
of which at that time, remained a mystery. But Mr. Taylor’s
practical collaborator—his librettist—was to be none other
than himself!</p>

<p>“I have found,” the composer related to a reporter for the
Associated Press, “the most charming and compatible, the most
accomplished and erudite of collaborators. We get along splendidly
together. It is true that I fuss and say crude things to this
collaborator, sometimes, but it is all taken in good grace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>This same interview revealed another phase of the Taylor
character, too significant to be overlooked in any discussion that
pretends to reveal the man.</p>

<p>He declared that his new opera would be a product of the
great city; that he had no tolerance for the widely exploited
quiet of the country generally believed to be indispensable to
those engaged in creative endeavor.</p>

<p>“I tried the country,” he confided to his interviewer, “and
it is too noisy. There are katydids, tree-toads, crickets, week-end
guests and mosquitoes; all terrible noise-makers. Besides, New
York is the only place I can be alone. In New York visitors stay
ten minutes. In the country they stay ten days.”</p>

<p>As to the nature of the new opera the composer described
it as tragic-comic; half phantasy and half realism. “It has overtones
of romance and nuances of practical life,” he said. “The
emotions are typically American.”</p>

<p>When the new owners of the weekly periodical, “Musical
America,” in search of an outstanding figure in the field of musical
literature, one who would merit a sympathetic response from the
musical public, selected Taylor for the post of editor-in-chief,
they did no more than to reflect the high esteem that he had won
for himself. The manner in which he took over the responsibility,
as revealed in his declaration of intentions, in the issue of August
27th, 1927, was thoroughly characteristic of the man. Here he
disclosed rare editorial acumen in a frank statement, analyzing
minutely the qualities which the average American music-lover
would seek in a journal, and promising that his program as director
of the enterprise would adequately satisfy those needs.</p>

<p>And so it becomes apparent that Deems Taylor the man is
quite as important as Deems Taylor the composer. No record
of his achievements in the latter capacity is complete without
mention of the sterling qualities that he built within his own
character. The chronicler of his history finds no evidence on this
point more startling nor convincing than the happy, friendly relationship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
which exists between him and his publisher. Here indeed
is a miracle, as witness the biographies of scores of the great
composers of all times and observe the bickerings and transactions
of distrust which have marked their dealings with the men
who gave out their music to the world.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI</h2>
</div>


<p>Taylor has written more than fifty compositions, a full catalog
of which is appended to this article. Without exception,
each of these works, large or small, is of importance, and individual.
Each bears analysis, but does not demand analysis for
its enjoyment. While the individuality of his work is not essentially
an idiom, and never a formula, there is always an atmosphere
and a color that command attention. The music is thoughtful,
yet spontaneous, reflective though objective; and so well
constructed and designed that the structure does not impose
itself on the listener.</p>

<p>Taylor’s severest critics have accused him of lacking a true
melodic gift. The most superficial study of his music should disprove
this charge. The <em>Looking Glass</em> Suite and <em>The King’s
Henchman</em> abound in melodies interesting in themselves and ingeniously
and logically developed. His best work has the quality
of inevitability which is the supreme test of greatness in art, an
inevitability which is never mere obviousness.</p>

<p>Comparisons are ever futile, and it is rarely profitable to
compare one composer with another. Suffice it to say that we
may claim Taylor as a native born composer, who needs no
apology, no qualifying adjectives, no patriotic propaganda, no
press agenting, and no circus methods for gaining recognition.
He has gained recognition not because of or despite the fact that
he is an American, but merely because he has written beautiful
music, worthy to rank with the great works of the world.</p>

<p>On several occasions Taylor has given advice to young composers,
either through interviews or articles written by himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
The doctrine he expounds is tersely summarised in an article in
“The Musical Digest,” as follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs80">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">1. Get to be a professional.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">2. Make everything you do count.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">3. Try not to avoid criticism, and not to mind it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">4. Try not to make the same mistake twice.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not easily given advice to be disregarded by the giver;
it is his own creed, reflected in every work in his list. He has
written no “pot-boilers,” made no concessions to the caprice of
a fickle public, followed no easy paths to a facile popularity.</p>

<p>In an interview in “The Musical Observer” he once stated:
“I think this country will produce some very bad composers and
a few very great ones. Bad ones, because it is so easy to be popular
here. You can please so many people by attaining a certain
level—a level which requires very small gifts. A few great ones
because anyone who has the nerve to be a good composer in this
country and is so recognized, must be big enough to appeal to
everybody, as the popular composer is bad enough to appeal to
everybody.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII</h2>
</div>


<p>Taylor’s songs and choral works are by-words on recital programs
and his shorter works are household words in concert hall
and studio. Those that have had the greatest vogue are <em>Mayday
Carol</em> and <em>Captain Stratton’s Fancy</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mayday Carol</em> is a setting of an Essex folk-song in which
the arranger has kept the warmth and simplicity of the original,
and yet given it a sophisticated background. The harmonization
is rich, and the counter melodies dextrously woven.</p>

<p><em>Captain Stratton’s Fancy</em> is a setting of the poem by John
Masefield, and the combination has proved a song that has been
the delight of hundreds of baritones. The spirit of the rum-loving
pirate, “the old bold mate of Henry Morgan,” is rollickingly
emphasized by the music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p><em>Banks o’ Doon</em> to a poem of Robert Burns, shows Taylor’s
lyric talent at its best. He has achieved the distinction of composing
a melody which has all the attributes of a folk-song. There
is simplicity, restraint, and yet a poignancy which brings out all
the tender warmth of the exquisite poem.</p>

<p>For piano, Taylor has written only two pieces, <em>Two Studies
in Rhythm</em>, Opus 5. These are a <em>Prelude</em> in 7-8 time, and a <em>Poem</em>
in 5-8 time. The rhythms are never manufactured, or artificial;
they are metric units written as conceived, spontaneous and natural.
As in the 5-4 movement of the Tchaikovsky <em>Pathetique</em>,
one forgets the unusual time divisions, because of the fluency of
the rhythmic sequence.</p>

<p>As a writer of choral music, Taylor has earned an enviable
distinction. Chief among his works for chorus are <em>The Chambered
Nautilus</em>, a cantata for mixed chorus and orchestra, Opus 7;
<em>The Highwayman</em>, a cantata for women’s voices and orchestra,
Opus 8; and the sixty arrangements for women’s voices of
<em>Traditional Airs</em>, which he made for the Schumann Club of New
York. In reviewing these transcriptions, Sidney Grew, the
English lecturer and critic, wrote as follows in “The Musical
Standard” (London):</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“In these arrangements of old-time pieces and folk-music Taylor seems to
have his own idea of the psychology of the poems, and occasionally he is (to
an Englishman’s mind) drawn away from the poetical idea of a piece and controlled
by the objective power of music. But this remark I make no more than
tentatively, because to prove it would require a very thoroughgoing study of
matters not within the range of a reviewer. He has a good contrapuntal sense,
but is not at all interested in contrapuntal subtleties. His harmonic sense is
free, yet he does little to disturb even the purist. In most of the numbers he
achieves or retains atmosphere; and in disposing the texts among long notes
in the accompanying parts he generally modifies the phrases so as to make
verbal sense. On the other hand, he often brings in a group of voices with
quite instrumental freedom, giving to these whatever words happen to be
going at the moment in the leading part. One point will please singers, Taylor’s
arrangements have no meaningless reiteration of words, but are all intellectually
clear and direct. Deems Taylor makes elaborate use of the humming voice,
sometimes as choral accompaniment to a solo melody and sometimes as a meditative
contrapuntal comment on the piece.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>The experience he gained in writing for voices has stood him
in good stead in his opera <em>The King’s Henchman</em>, for his magnificent
choruses are among its finest moments.</p>

<p>Of his orchestral works, the earliest was <em>The Siren Song</em>,
Opus 2, written in 1912, but not performed until 1923, despite
the fact that in 1913 it won the orchestral prize awarded by
the National Federation of Women’s Clubs. Taylor’s opinion
of the work is at variance with those of his fellow critics. At
the time the Philharmonic played <em>The Siren Song</em>, as critic of
the “World,” he wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“We thought it a promising work with a certain freshness of feeling and a
disarming simplicity of utterance that partly atoned for its lack of well-defined
individuality. It followed the program with clarity and a degree of dramatic
effectiveness, although the music did not seem to reach very far beneath the
surface of the subtle and rather neurotic poem whose mood it aimed to express.”</p>
</div>

<p>Henry T. Finck, writing in the “Post,” valued the work more
highly:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Deems Taylor’s <em>The Siren Song</em> is marked Opus 2. It would be a remarkably
interesting composition if it were an Opus 20, or beyond. To be sure
it betrays the influence of Wagner, but that’s a most desirable influence. The
three themes are distinctly recognizable and well worked out, with stunning
climaxes and real dramatic and atmospheric sense for the sea and the siren.
It is a fine mood picture and well worth keeping in the repertory.”</p>
</div>

<p>The piece is written after a poem by Joseph Tiers, Jr., which
tells of mariners hearing the siren’s song, and either losing their
souls, or resisting, being haunted by her voice forever. There
are two principal themes, one representing the “Sea” and the
other the “Siren,” followed by a martial passage in lighter vein.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2>
</div>


<p><em>Through the Looking Glass</em> was originally written in 1917-19
for strings, wind and piano, and performed by the New York
Chamber Music Society. In 1921-22 Taylor rescored the suite
for full orchestra, and it is now a regular feature of the repertoire
of our leading orchestras. It is principally through this work that
he first achieved his fame as a composer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>In reviewing the suite for the “New York Tribune,” Lawrence
Gilman wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“He is wit enough to know that the peculiar distinction of Carroll’s delicious
masterpiece is the mood of half tender, half mocking detachment in
which it is conceived; and he preserves this balance in his music with extraordinary
skill and felicity. He neither burlesques nor sentimentalizes his subject.
He touches it affectionately, even caressingly, as in the poetic and sensitive
<em>Dedication</em>; but in his eye is a twinkle that is imperfectly suppressed.
Incidentally, he has composed an admirable piece of music—distinguished in
invention, ingenious in facture, and expertly scored.”</p>
</div>

<p>The suite is, of course, based on Lewis Carroll’s immortal
nonsense tale <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>, and its four movements
are selected from portions and episodes of the book.</p>

<p>The first movement is divided into two parts. It opens with the
<em>Dedication</em>, and the score quotes the dedicatory verse of the author:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Child of the pure, unclouded brow</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Thy loving smile will surely hail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The love-gift of a fairy-tale.”</div>

<p>This melody is next given to the clarinets, and then again to
the strings as its brief development leads to the second part of
the first movement, <em>The Garden of Live Flowers</em>. Here Alice finds
herself surrounded by talkative flowers, who, to quote the tigerlily,
will speak “when there’s anybody worth talking to.” The
music reflects the brisk chatter of the garden folk:</p>

<p>The second movement, <em>Jabberwocky</em>, is without doubt the
masterpiece of the suite, for in it Taylor shows his skill as a tonal
narrator, his humor, and his consummate mastery of orchestration.
After a seven measure introduction, a solo clarinet establishes
the “brillig” atmosphere with this motive:</p>

<p>In the third movement, <em>Looking Glass Insects</em>, the composer
again shows us his ability in orchestration, this time with more
delicate touches. The several themes describe the bee-elephant,
the rocking-horse-fly, the snap-dragon-fly, and the bread-and-butter-fly,
but as the composer himself remarks, “there is no use
trying to decide which insect any one of them stands for.”</p>

<p>The fourth movement tells of <em>The White Knight</em>, the “toy
Don Quixote, mild, chivalrous, ridiculous, and rather touching,”

<p>American critics have been practically unanimous in their
praise of the <em>Looking Glass</em> Suite, but when it was first played in
London (1925) at the Queen’s Hall Promenade Concerts, the
English writers were by no means unqualified in their approval.
A perusal of their comments almost gives one the impression
that they resented an American’s attempt to depict such
characteristically British humor.</p>

<p>The reviewer of the “Evening Standard” said: “... his
suite is curiously uneven. In places it is heavy and long-winded;
Lewis Carroll was neither.”</p>

<p>The critic of the “Daily Express” was more complimentary,
as was the “Daily Sketch,” but the writer for the “Morning
Post” stated:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“... his capacity for detail misleads him. Instead of creating a vision by a
wave of his hand, he fills in his picture inch by inch, carefully balancing his
outlines and masses, and filling the whole of his rectangle with subject matter.
A good musician, no doubt, but far from catching the white rabbit.”</p>
</div>

<p>With these adverse comments we cannot agree. The pages
of the Suite are not smothered with detail, the episodes and pictures
of the book are impressions clearly delineated, and painted
with a sparkle and brilliance that prove irresistible and dazzling.</p>

<p>The <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> was composed shortly after the
<em>Looking Glass</em> Suite, and rewritten in 1924. Ernest Newman
wrote of it in the “Post”:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“... he stood up like a man to Schubert, Juon and Novak; and at the end
of the concert only he and Schubert had survived.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lawrence Gilman of the “Tribune” said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Out of the empty, agitated air he conjured an image that had line and
color and background, substance and character; something coherent, vivid,
personal. And when he was through ... we found ourselves richer by an
experience and a possession, and wondering, as we never fail to do, at the
mysterious potency of the art of music.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>The work was composed for strings, wood-wind and piano,
and, according to the composer, follows no definite program, but
was designed to be “somewhat analogous to what a painter
would call an ideal head; an attempt to convey the impression
of a human personality in terms of music.” According to the
music this personality has two phases: one grave, meditative
and tender, the other capricious and somewhat worldly. The
music has warmth and depth, and as W. J. Henderson wrote in
the “Sun,” “makes one wish to see the woman.”</p>

<p>The incidental music to <em>Beggar on Horseback</em> included the
delightful pantomime <em>A Kiss in Xanadu</em>, to a scenario by Winthrop
Ames. Taylor wrote this for two pianos, and we may well
hope that he carries out his intention of scoring it for orchestra.</p>

<p>The music radiates moonlight and romance, and its humor
enhances the spirit of satire. The opening measures establish the
atmosphere with a 5-4 theme:</p>

<p class="no-indent">The third scene finishes as the pantomime began, with a colorful
reminiscence of the opening themes.</p>

<p>Taylor’s next important work is <em>Jurgen</em>, a symphonic work
for full orchestra, based on Cabell’s famous novel. His own
statement of his aims in regard to it are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“<em>Jurgen</em> was originally planned as an orchestral suite that would follow as
faithfully as possible the sequence of events in James Branch Cabell’s book.
But when I started work on the music it became increasingly obvious that such
a program was not only impracticable, but hardly to the point. It would take
a cycle of suites to do adequate justice to the bewildering multitude of scenes,
characters and episodes with which the pages of <em>Jurgen</em> are crowded. Moreover,
the importance of Cabell’s romance as a work of art lies, not in its qualities
as a diverting tale of amorous adventure, but in the vividness, the sardonic
gusto, the humor and wisdom and pathetic beauty with which the tale is told.</p>

<p>“So, <em>Jurgen</em>, annotated in terms of music, has come to be concerned much
more with the man Jurgen than with his deeds. In brief, I have tried to show
Jurgen, facing the unanswerable riddle of why things are as they are; Jurgen
‘clad in the armor of his hurt’, spinning giddily through life, strutting, posturing,
fighting, loving, pretending; Jurgen proclaiming himself count, duke, king,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
emperor, god; Jurgen, beaten at last by the pathos and mystery of life, bidding
farewell to that dream of beauty, which he had the vision to see, but not the
strength to follow.”</p>
</div>

<p>Continuing his explanation of the work, Taylor writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“The music is built upon four themes. The first of these, which is Jurgen’s
own, is announced at the outset, in its broadest and vaguest form, by the bass</p>

fourth theme, broadly lyric, is first heard in the cellos, at the beginning of the

<p><em>Jurgen’s</em> performance in 1925 by the Symphony Society was
met with mixed emotions on the part of the press reviewers.
Mr. Chotzinoff, Taylor’s successor on the “World,” was laudatory
with reservations; Mr. Henderson of the “Sun” felt that
the score was too long, but added that this may have been because
it followed Kallinikoff and Brahms on a lengthy program.
He wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“It is a broadly painted musical canvas which loses itself just a little too
much in the philosophical depths of Jurgen’s nature. The reflective pages in
the score are a little longer than the reflective mood of a typical audience. These
pages are saturated with feeling, with poetic character, with musical emotion;
but they are pages to be read in the shadows of the twilight.... These
pages Mr. Taylor has composed with a splendid verve, with brilliant thematic
conception, with opulence of color and his own unquenchable spirit of defiant
humor. There is music in every page, music that should bring gladness to the
American music lover in that it was made by an American.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX</h2>
</div>


<p>No better introduction to a discussion of <em>The King’s Henchman</em>
could be found than another quotation from Mr. Gilman,
written in the “Tribune” on the occasion of the opera’s première
at the Metropolitan:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Thus we came to the end of the best American opera we have ever
heard, and so easily the best of the ten produced by Mr. Gatti-Casazza at the
Metropolitan that there is none other in the running. Mr. Taylor has woven
a deft and often lovely sounding score about a superb poetic text—a text pithy
and glamorous and full of character; rich in humor and dramatic force, rich in
imagery that is often startling in its beauty and its swift felicity. And this
text is apt for voices or for viols. It clamors for vocal utterance and for enforcement
by the instruments of the mirroring orchestra.</p>

<p>“Mr. Taylor’s score is in the worthiest sense theatrically planned and developed.
It is obvious that he wrote with his eye on the stage, with his intelligence
responsive to its tyrannous requirements. Furthermore, he has given
musical voice to English words which, sung from the stage, are not only heard,
but are expressive, and fitting, and often beautiful. The music, as music,
“sounds”; it fills the ear, is richly textured, mellifluous, has grace and movement
and flexibility. It is the writing of an expert craftsman, an artist of sensibility
and warm responsiveness.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>For her libretto, Miss Millay went to the England of the
ninth century for her setting, and, in authentic Anglo-Saxon
verbiage tells us the story of Eadgar, King of England, a widower
who wishes a second wife. Like King Mark in <em>Tristan</em>, he dispatches
a trusted retainer, Aethelwold, to bring to him Aelfrida,
daughter of the Thane of Devon, of whose beauty he has heard.
Like Tristan and like John Alden, Aethelwold falls in love with
the lady himself, and tragedy is inevitable.</p>

<p>It has often been remarked that the weaker the libretto, the
better the opera. If any proof were needed to challenge so obvious
a fallacy, <em>The King’s Henchman</em> provides it, for here is a
poetic drama which of itself stands in perfect security. In the
“Tribune” Elinor Wylie wrote, after reading the poem:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“If this is not lyric dialogue of the true poetic water, why then has it
such a magic in it that it has turned me into a fool and my taste into untruth.”</p>
</div>

<p>The story is grippingly told, the tragedy of it appalling, and
the characters are limned with an insight that makes them real
people, actuated by motives beyond their control.</p>

<p>Because of his wisdom in choosing his librettist, Taylor commenced
his work with a drama that cried out for musical setting,
for a tonal accompaniment to its atmosphere, and to the thoughts
and actions of its people; and if in the making of it he has fallen
under the spell of Wagner’s musical delineation of the kindred
love-drama <em>Tristan</em>, or of Debussy, whose love scene in <em>Pelleas</em> is
akin to the forest scene in <em>The King’s Henchman</em>, who can blame
him, for who could have avoided it? Taylor himself has said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Its form has undoubtedly been influenced by the methods of past masters
...; as to that, I can only hope that its spiritual grandfather may turn out
to be Wagner rather than Puccini.”</p>
</div>

<p>The score of <em>The King’s Henchman</em> makes frequent use of
the <em>leit-motif</em>, to represent both actual characters, and abstract conceptions.
The short prelude opens with the King (Eadgar) motive:</p>

<p class="no-indent">After a brief development, the curtain rises and reveals the hall
of King Eadgar’s castle with the King and his nobles seated at the
table, while Maccus, the harper, sings of deeds of valor. Then
follows a choral response, with the words:</p>

<p class="no-indent">While they are talking about Aethelwold he enters, and the
expedition is planned, the henchman receives his final instructions,
the Archbishop gives his reluctant blessing, and, as the
pledge is sealed we first hear the pledge motive:</p>

<p class="no-indent">which is quoted frequently throughout the opera. As the knights
drink Aethelwold’s health and bid him godspeed, there comes a
rousing choral arrangement of the only folk-song used in the
entire work:</p>

And Julius was thy name!<br>

And to stormy Britain came!<br>
But I would not stand in thy stead,<br>
For I’d liefer be quick than dead!<br>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and so on, through others of the Caesars involved in the Roman
invasion of England: Claudius and Hadrian. The handling of voices
and orchestra in this chorus is the most stunning choral writing
Taylor has ever achieved. After this song, Aethelwold’s horse
is brought in and he takes his departure as the curtain falls, and
the orchestra sounds the Aethelwold motive as a salvo.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The second act is chiefly an extended love scene, and the impassioned
prelude, commencing with the Aethelwold motive,
establishes the mood and atmosphere. As the curtain rises, a
forest in Devon is discovered, on the Eve of All Hallow Mass.
A thick fog causes Aethelwold and Maccus, who accompanies
him, to lose their way and become separated. The orchestra,
with muted strings, weaves a background of forest murmurings
as Aethelwold stretches himself beneath an oak. As he falls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
asleep a light appears, and we hear a theme which is later associated
with the love scene:</p>

<p class="no-indent">As Aelfrida enters with a lantern we again hear her motive. She
had come to practice a magic spell, hoping that her incantation
would bring her a lover. As she hums the tune, “white-thorn,
black-thorn, holy-bough, speed-well,” a ghostly chorus behind
the scenes answers her. As the mist clears, the moonlight falls
upon Aethelwold, and she kisses him. As he arises they fall in
each other’s arms; and then begins one of the most beautiful love
duets in the literature of music. It is based on the principal love-theme
of the opera:</p>

Ah, could we hide us in the night,<br>
And never be found!<br>
</div>

<p>They tell each other their names, and Aethelwold horror-stricken
learns who she is. As Aelfrida leaves him, to return in a
moment, the henchman is left alone to make his decision. The
orchestra tells us of his inner strife, we hear reminders of the
King’s motive, and the pledge; he tries to flee, but her voice detains
him, and as Maccus appears seeking him, he gives way to
his temptation and dispatches his harper to the King, with this
message:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Maccus, go back unto the King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And say to him:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I have seen the maiden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And found her nothing fair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A comely maid enough, and friendly spoken,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But nothing for the King.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Further say:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That whereas the Thane of Devon, the lady’s father,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And whereas the Lord Aethelwold</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The blessing of King Eadgar is besought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the wedding of Lord Aethelwold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unto the maid Aelfrida.”</div>

<p>As Maccus departs, Aethelwold turns to Aelfrida, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center no-indent">“Now shall I look no more beyond thine eyes.”</p>
</div>

<p>Both words and music, throughout the act, portray Aethelwold’s
intense desire to be loyal to his King, but show the complete
inability of almost any man to resist the spell woven by
the forest. The music achieves a compelling mood of rapturous
lyricism, and its broadly drawn phrases of sensuous melody build
up magnificently to the climax of the act.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI</h2>

<p>The prelude to the third act starts with a tune, in the
folk-song manner, sung by the wood-winds:</p>

<p class="no-indent">As the curtain rises we find Ase, Aelfrida’s serving maid, singing
while she spins in the hall of Ordgar’s house, where Aethelwold
is living with his bride. Then comes a tense scene between
Aelfrida and Aethelwold, for she is fretted by her preoccupation
with the cares of the household, and not wholly content with a
husband whose unconfessed treachery must have caused him
many sleepless nights. Aethelwold accordingly plans that they
shall leave Devon immediately, and go to Ghent in Flanders
where Aelfrida would henceforth go “in sighing silk and gossamer
and hooded in beaver-fell.” As they sing farewell to Devon
the orchestra commences a theme which is heard at different
times throughout the act, a melody of great beauty and pathos:</p>

come on a friendly visit. Aethelwold confesses his deception to
his wife:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p class="no-indent">He then bids Aelfrida help him keep up his deception to the
King, and to retire and dim her beauty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go now, and darken thy cheek with the sap of the walnut,</div>

<p class="no-indent">Aelfrida departs to do his bidding—or so Aethelwold thinks.</p>

<p>Eadgar and his men enter singing the folk-song of the first act.
As he greets Aethelwold, and asks to be taken to the bride,
Aelfrida suddenly appears in the doorway, in all her jewels,
proud, beautiful and splendid. Eadgar’s arm slowly drops from
Aethelwold’s shoulders, and the orchestra in a discordant crash
sounds the pledge motive.</p>

<p>After Eadgar’s sorrowful rebuke, Aethelwold plunges his
dagger into his breast, and a brief threnody is spoken by the
King. Then follows the choral ending of the opera, with the
King intoning his lament against the chorus of retainers and
woodsmen, and the orchestra playing a passage, reminiscent of
the “farewell to Devon” theme!—</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
